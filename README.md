App title  --------------------There--------------------


 --------app description----
The porpose of the app is to search for events within user criteria and give the user the ability to
choose which ever event they would like.


-------API-------
I am using the ticket master API which allows for 5000 calls per day.
The information that i plan to use, is getting the event zipcode, or city or location or other
depending on what the user chooses to do.

------API snippet -------

-------wire frames------

--------MVP-------
the main features will be the search by differnt criteria and it will return that information.

add a clickable interface to all the cards so the user can be directed to the site where they can purchase tickets to their choosen event
